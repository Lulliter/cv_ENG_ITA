# Purpose

In this this R project I my CV/resume following Mitchell O'Hara-Wild's [R package `vitae`](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) ("awesome"" template define in LATEX in `awesome-cv.cls` )

I have 4 versions:

-   Long, in Italian üáÆüáπ
-   Long, in English üá∫üá∏
-   Short, in Italian üáÆüáπ (2 versions)
-   Short, in English üá∫üá∏

## NOTES

-   ‚úÖ `lang: "it"` for Italian in bibliography ‚òëÔ∏è but footer stays ni EN "June 2023"
-   ‚úÖ A major "gotcha" ü§Ø was the possibility to insert Publications & Talks exploiting my **Zotero** collections in the `....bib` format that can be entered directly via the function `vitae::bibliography_entries`.
    -   (\*) when exporting from Zotero better to select BetterBibLaTeX
-   ‚úÖ Most other information is saved in `./data/*.csv`which get loaded via `data/cv_data_ENG_ITA.R`, except for Competences (Personal, Software, Language) which are defined in `*.Rmd` files
    -    ‚ö†Ô∏è see notes in the `.Rmd` files on how to deal with `csv -> latex` formatting nightmare (
    -   ‚òëÔ∏è fixing `.*csv` files directly from Excel or R will have different implications on `""` rendering via latex
-   ‚ùì the language tables (copied from [Lorena Abad](https://github.com/loreabad6/R-CV)) use `knitr::kable()` with `latex_options`... this implicated downloading of LaTeX packages (`float`, `xcolor`, `colortbl`?)...which have been giving issues with compiling
-   ‚úÖ The best way to deal with "ANONIMIZATION" (i.e. Eutalia) is directly on `PDFreader` by redacting the PDF

## TO DOs

-   ‚òëÔ∏è revise and write instructions to be consistent adding rows to `.*csv` files in terms of quotes/links etc

-   ‚òëÔ∏è ~~Current version of `vitae` does not print footer anymore...fixed by dev version~~

-   ‚ùì`apa6-cv.csl` seems OK except hyperlink exceed page width.... must check other formatting

## RECURRENT FIXES

-   ‚òëÔ∏è The `vitae` pckg relies on LaTeX "if you're encountering issues, please check that LaTeX is installed. The [tinytex package](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex) makes it easy to setup LaTeX within R:

    ```` r
        install.packages('tinytex')
        tinytex::install_tinytex()
        ```
    -   See <https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging> for debugging tips.
    -   Check LaTeX packgs installed ( or not installed)
    ``` r
    tinytex::tl_pkgs(only_installed = T)
    tinytex::check_installed('xcolor') #TRUE
    tinytex::parse_packages('awesome_longCV_ENG.log')
    ````

    -   Find the root directory of the installation v

    ``` r
    tinytex::tinytex_root()
    [1] "/Users/luisamimmi/Library/TinyTeX"
    ```

## Acknowledgements

-   **Mitchell O'Hara-Wild** R package `vitae`, along with:
    -   Youtube video by **Bryan Jenks** on `vitae` [Free Code Camp Talk: Making A Data Driven CV With RMarkdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMlRAiQUdD8&t=113s)
    -   Some variations on the above seen in **Lorena Abad Crespo**'s version shared [here](https://github.com/loreabad6/R-CV). To make this version, I had to modify the `awesome-cv.cls` file

``` css
      % Add fontawesome5 package 
      \RequirePackage{fontawesome5}
      \RequirePackage[default,opentype]{sourcesanspro}
```

-   Future attempt could be this [Github action to develop resume!](https://github.com/rahulrai-in/csf-resume-ops/blob/5b12e8adc82a96e738f4ea1a89a180006234c2f8/README.md)
